Usage Notes
-----------

Kafka sink plugin that allows you to convert a Structured Record into CSV or JSON.
Plugin has the capability to push the data to one or more Kafka topics. It can
use one of the field values from input to partition the data on topic. The sink

In case of failure the failed event will not be sent to kafka topic for which it failed.
